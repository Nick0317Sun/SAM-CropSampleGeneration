# SAM-CropSampleGeneration
## Background
This is an exploration on what [Segment Anything Model (SAM)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) can do for remote sensing involving medium-resolution satellite imagery. Specifically, a sample generation approach based on SAM is proposed to solve sample scarcity problem in crop mapping.The workflow is shown in the picture.
